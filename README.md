This GitHub Repo contains a two month delayed dump of temporary disposable email addresses within the [Temp Mail Detector](http://tempmaildetector.com/?utm_source=github-blocklist) database.

For an up to date database, with real time analysis, sign up to our API. This dump contains both domains our software has ranked as high risk, as well as domains which we have crawled for. Our [Documentation](https://tempmaildetector.com/documentation?utm_source=github-blocklist) provides an easy to follow guide on how to implement our API and gain access to the real-time domains from our database.

Expired domains are systematically removed and re-evaluated to maintain a clean and reliable data set.
